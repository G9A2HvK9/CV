## Hendrik Geiger

I am an ambitious, excitable and internationally aware young professional, with experience working in start-ups, currently working to become a junior developer at Makers Academy in London. After completing various internships in the tech- and start-up sector, I moved to London where I helped to establish an international recruitment business. Ideally, I am looking for a challenging and fulfilling job opportunity in the start-up or consulting space in Germany.

### Skills

**Business Development & Relationship Management**

I worked for an early-stage international recruitment venture, specialising in the audit & risk advisory market. Under my own initiative, I was solely responsible for business developing the German market and was the manager for many of the businesse's key-accounts in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria and France. My strong performance lead to best-in-class performance and early promotions.

**Strategy & Operations**

Both at university, as well as in my first job, I was involved in establishing and building small organisations in competitive markets. My degree in Management & Economics from the University of St Andrews allowed me apply many of the theoretical concepts we learned in the classroom in real-life environments. At Hanami, for example, I was responsible for preparing and giving presentations to our CEOs and investors on risks associated with Brexit and how we could mediate these risks to the business.

**Recruitment, Hiring & Mentoring**

From University onwards I have been heavily involved in young, growing organisations who view people as their key-asset. Especially at University, where your entire organisation turns over every 4 years, recruitment of new members and handing over of processes and information becomes extremely important. Similarly, recruitment has a notoriously high turnover rate and especially a young and budding business must take care to hire the right talent. My personally assigned mentee has been outperforming her peers under my instruction and is continuing to do so.
