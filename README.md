## Hendrik Geiger

## Summary

I am a well-trained junior developer with experience in writing ruby and javascript web apps. I have a strong background in start-ups; both from a business-development and operational perspective. Having been educated in the English language from an early age, I am completely fluent in German and English and have experience working in a diverse set of countries and cultures. Ideally I would like to work in a multi-disciplinary role which allows me to leverage my passion for coding as well as my drive to grow ventures.


### Skills

**Web Development**

I received excellent training in web-development at Makers Academy in London. Adhering closely to the industry norms of test-diven development and pair programming, I completed a number of challenging coding tasks and even developed a market-ready minimum viavle product in a team of 5. I focussed especially on learning javascript and related libraries, but also gained significant expertise in ruby.

**Business Development & Relationship Management**

As part of James Caan's recruitment entrepreneur business accelerator, I worked for Hanami International, an early stage international recruitment venture specialising in the audit & risk advisory markets world wide. Under my own initiative, I was solely responsible for business developing the German market and was the manager for many of the businesse's key-accounts in the Netherlands, Switzerland, Austria and France. Although the London recruitment market is the most competitive in the world, our venture quickly established itself as a key player in this niche segment. My contribution to the growth of the business was invaluable, as I became the highest billing consultant, even amongst much more experienced peers.

**Strategy & Operations**

Both at university, as well as in my first job, I was involved in establishing and building small organisations in competitive markets. My degree in Management & Economics from the University of St Andrews allowed me apply many of the theoretical concepts we learned in the classroom in real-life environments. At Hanami, for example, I was responsible for preparing and giving presentations to our CEOs and investors on risks associated with Brexit and how we could mediate these risks to the business.

**Recruitment, Hiring & Mentoring**

From University onwards I have been heavily involved in young, growing organisations who view people as their key-asset. Especially at University, where your entire organisation turns over every 4 years, recruitment of new members and handing over of processes and information becomes extremely important. Similarly, recruitment has a notoriously high turnover rate and especially a young and budding business must take care to hire the right talent. My personally assigned mentee has been outperforming her peers under my instruction and is continuing to do so.
